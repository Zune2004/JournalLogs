 ## Day 3 Journal

##  What did I learn about statistics today?
I learned how to calculate core statistics like mean, median, std dev, and how to apply Bayes’ Theorem for probability. It gave me a solid base for understanding ML metrics.

##  Which DSA problem was hardest? Easiest?
- Hardest: Reversing the linked list (initially tricky to track pointers).
- Easiest: Creating and printing the linked list.

##  What surprised me about working with forms?
How easy it was to style HTML forms with just a bit of CSS.

##  One thing I want to remember?
Bayes' Theorem changes how we think about conditional probability—it’s not always intuitive.

##  Highlights:
- Cleaned and visualized Titanic dataset
- Wrote 3 stats-based Python programs
- Built and reversed a linked list
- Created a contact form with HTML & CSS
- Made a fun ASCII art generator!
