#  My Coding Learning Journey

##  Day 4: Supervised Learning, Stacks & Queues, CSS Layouts, Docker

Today I focused on several key areas in my full-stack and ML development journey:

### Supervised Learning
- Learned the fundamentals of supervised learning models
- Implemented both **regression** (predicting house prices) and **classification** (breast cancer detection)
- Used scikit-learn to train models and evaluate their performance
- Visualized classification results with confusion matrices

###  Data Structures: Stacks & Queues
- Built stack and queue implementations from scratch
- Learned the key differences:
  - Stack: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)
  - Queue: First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
- Applied stacks to solve the balanced parentheses problem
- Created a print queue simulation

###  CSS Layouts: Flexbox & Grid
- Created responsive dashboard layouts using both techniques
- Learned when to use each:
  - Flexbox: One-dimensional layouts (row OR column)
  - Grid: Two-dimensional layouts (rows AND columns)
- Implemented responsive design with media queries

###  Docker Introduction
- Created a Flask API that serves machine learning predictions
- Wrote a Dockerfile to containerize the application
- Learned the basic Docker commands for building and running containers
- Documented the process for future reference

###  Vibe Coding
- Built an interactive command-line quiz game
- Implemented multiple categories: Python, ML, and Data Structures
- Added scoring, feedback, and replay functionality

## ðŸ”§ Files & Projects

##  Summary & Reflections

Today was packed with learning across multiple domains. I'm starting to see how these different technologies can work together:

- ML models can be deployed via Flask APIs
- Docker makes deployment consistent across environments
- Well-designed UI is crucial for presenting data effectively
- Data structures are fundamental to efficient programming

The most challenging concept today was understanding Docker and containerization, but I can now see how powerful it is for deployment. I'm excited to continue building on these skills!
